## Short bio
In **2004**, I developed my first large program, a *Platform-based Video-game in Pascal*, and in **2005**, in collaboration with the Electrical Engineering school, a *Basic domotics system in C++*. I graduated from High School with a *Computer Programming degree* in **2006**. In **2007**, immediately after High School graduation and while pursuing a *Bachelor’s Degree in Systems Engineering*, I started a full-time job, first as a *Support Engineer* at *Intel Corporation*, and later at *Hewlett-Packard* in the *HP Software department*. Between **2007** and **2009**, I developed a *Store Management system* for a Costa Rican mid-size store using *Visual Basic and MySQL*. For my graduation project, between **2011** and **2012**, I developed an *Inventory & Order Management system* for a major hospital using *ASP.net with Oracle 10g*. I completed my *Bachelor’s Degree in Systems Engineering* in **2012** from *National University of Costa Rica*.  In **2013**, I developed a *cloud-based Client Visits Management & Logging system* for a healthcare product distributor. Between **2010** and **2014**, I developed a series of smaller projects in *Perl, Python, Javascript, and PHP*, besides my regular work in HP Software. In **2014**, I took a series of classes as part of a *Masters Program in Project Management* from *Costa Rica Institute of Technology*, and in **2015** a *Licentiate’s Degree in Computer Systems* from *Fidélitas University*. In **2015**, I started working for *Aruba Networks* as an *Embedded Software Engineer*. My contributions to the *ArubaOS-CX Network Operating System* and the *Continuous Integration* platform are detailed in the respective section. In **2017**, I started the studies for my *M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech*. The expected graduation date is **Summer 2021**. In **2020**, I am eager to complete my Master’s degree and take on my next challenge.

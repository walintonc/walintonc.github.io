## Bio
In **2004**, I developed my first large program, a *Platform-based Video-game in Pascal* for the school's scientific fair where it was awarded  "**Most popular project**", and in **2005**, in collaboration with the Electrical Engineering school, a *Basic domotics system in C++*. I graduated from High School with a *Computer Programming degree* in **2006**. In **2007**, immediately after High School graduation and while pursuing a *Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering in Information Systems*, I started a full-time job, first as a *Support Engineer* at *Intel Corporation*, and later at *Hewlett-Packard* in the *HP Software department*. Between **2007** and **2009**, I developed a *Store Management system* for a Costa Rican mid-size store using *Visual Basic and MySQL*. In **2010**, the global head of HP Software Services and Solutions awarded me for my "**Dedication and Professionalism**". For my graduation project, between **2011** and **2012**, I developed an *Inventory & Order Management system* for a major hospital using *ASP.net and MS-SQL*. I completed my *Bachelor’s Degree in Systems Engineering* in **2013** from *National University of Costa Rica*.  In **2013**, I developed a *cloud-based Client Visits Management & Logging system* for a healthcare product distributor. Between **2010** and **2014**, I developed a series of smaller projects in *Perl, Python, Javascript, and PHP*, besides my regular work for HP Software. In **2014**, I took a series of classes as part of a *Masters Program in Project Management* from *Costa Rica Institute of Technology*, and in **2015** a *Licentiate’s Degree in Computer Systems* from *Fidélitas University*. In **2015**, I started working for *Aruba Networks* as an *Embedded Software Engineer*. In **2016** I was awarded by the VP of Switch Software for my "**Dedication to making our products a success**". Between **2016** and **2020**, I made major contributions to the *ArubaOS-CX Network Operating System* and the *Continuous Integration* platform, including containerization research, software optimization, plugabble mechanisms to facilitate root-cause analysis, high-availability and virtualization. In **2017**, I started the studies for my *M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech*. The expected graduation date is **Summer 2021**.
